In our project we would like to use machine learning algorithms to classify the genre of a given song.

We would like to answer or explore the following questions while making this project:
1. How we use the mp3/wav files for machine learning? do we need to conver them to one format or we need to
   convert them to a photo or other way of presentation for them to indentify the genre.
2. What kind of data manipulation if at, all is needed?
3. How to use and create random forests? and how is it compaired to the other machine learning algorithms:
    1. Random Forests.
    2. Decision Trees.
    3. KNN.
    4. Adaboost
    5. Neural Networks.

-- Created the project and downloaded the dadasets.
-- converted all the mp3 files to wav files in the emotional dataset.
